Python 3.5.2

MySQL 5.7 (only mysql server and mysql workbench)
On installing my sql ensure that you remember the password!

Add mysql/bin folder to Enviroment variables
From the command prompt type : "mysql -u root -p" (next it will ask for a password)

You must create a database to use in django
mysql > CREATE DATABASE websitedb CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin; (thats to make sure that the db uses utf8)

See where the database is created
mysql > SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "%datadir%";
If you didn't change the path when installing mysql the db is here (with the .opt extension(in a folder with the db name))
C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\Data\

Also you need a connector for python to communicate with Mysql DB
For that : "pip install mysqlclient"

Configuration in settings.py django for mysql looks like this:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'websitedb',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'pass',
        'HOST': 'localhost', # Or an IP Address that your DB is hosted on
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}

Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
